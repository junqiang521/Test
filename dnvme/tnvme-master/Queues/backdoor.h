/**
* This interface to any SQ can be volatile and toxic if you are to use it in
* the manner described and the underlying assumptions within dnvme are
* ignored. Do NOT use this unless you are certain you understand the
* implications, it will crash the kernel, or cause strange behavior.
*
* The framework attempts to allow the maximum flexibility, but should never
* allow crashing the kernel. Thus dnvme implements safe-guards and error
* checking only to those things which could bring about a catastrophe. Certain
* assumptions have been made by dnvme to carry out cmd execution in a general
* fashion, like tracking PRP lists and IRQ’s, etc. If these assumptions are
* violated the kernel will most likely crash.
*
* There are conditions for which we want to test, or inject illegal conditions
* to verify proper rejection by a device. But these attempts violate the
* assumptions made by dnvme. Originally the intention was to do these things
* as a “hybrid approach” where they would be placed into the kernel as canned
* tests cases. However it was realized that the same issues are relevant in the
* kernel and that it would be just as efficient, or more so, to do them in user
* space, so as long as the developer knew the risks.
*
* Therefore, a backdoor was introduced, which could allow send a LEGAL cmd to
* dnvme, conforming to the proper interaction, but before ringing the doorbell,
* one could inject an illegal value into some position into that cmd. The idea
* is that the device will be rejecting the cmd and the fail safe checking could
* be avoided in these rare cases.
*
* This is not the norm. The tnvme/dnvme framework already allowed injecting
* illegal values for a cmd. This interface is ONLY meant to allow illegal
* things that are in most cases probably something a tester would never want
* to do, and are therefore rejected by dnvme outright. These 1-off test
* scenarios can be done but only if the developer truly understand the risks
* being violated.
*
* ******************************************************************************
* If you find yourself using this interface, in most cases your probably not
* going about the test in the correct manner. It is recommended to contact
* compliance@nvmexpress.org to toss out your idea to valid the coding attempt.
