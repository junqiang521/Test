/**
* This class is the base/interface class for all individual test cases.
* This class purposely enforces children to conform and inherit certain
* functionality to handle mundane tasks.
*
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ----------------Mandatory rules for children to follow-----------------------
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 1) During construction populate member Test::mTestDesc
* 2) Utilize class RsrcMngr to create objects to pass to subsequent tests which
*    are all part of the same group.
* 3) Heap allocations taken during test execution, and not under the control
*    of the RsrcMngr, must be deleted in destructor.
* 4) The creation of member variables is allowed but special attention to
*    copy construction and operator=() must be implemented in all children.
*    See the comment in Test::Clone() for complete details.
* 5) Execute dbgMemLeak.sh to find any memory leaks as a result of adding and
*    running any new test cases.
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* @note This class will not throw exceptions.
