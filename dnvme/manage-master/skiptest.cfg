# The skip test file is a list of individual test cases or an entire group of
# tests which are to be skipped in execution. The specified tests will never be
# run even if told to do so via a cmd line option. The only exception to this
# rule is that nothing and nobody is allowed to skip GrpInformative, i.e. group
# reference number 0. This file can be used for various reasons:
# 1) A known bug is failing a test case and a hardware vendor may wish to
#    execute the test suite without the nuisance of being reminded of this bug.
# 2) Tests which are not supported by a simulated hardware environment, but will
#    run against a real device, will need to be skipped.
#
# Rules:
#  1) Char '#' denotes a comment, all characters following '#' are ignored
#  2) Each line contain exactly 1 test case or 1 group of tests to skip
#  3) A line may contain both a test case or group reference followed by comment
#  4) The test case format string is: <grp>:<x>.<y>.<z>
#  5) The group format string is: <grp>
#  6) Whitespace is ignored everywhere.
    

# Group PCI registers synactic must be skipped for QEMU because writing to the
# RO bits of BAR0 and BAR1 are allowed. This causes the controller register
# space to become remapped and then subsequent access to that space fails. In
# real hardware this test should be run, RO bits should not be allowed writable.
